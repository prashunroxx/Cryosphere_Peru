# Cryosphere_Peru
<h4>The excel sheet contains the records of various glaciers in Peru, Brazil Region</h4>
<h5>There is a Machine Learning Model using Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm. The objective is to find the minimum height of cryospheric region which would help in prediction of rise in level of water bodies causing even catastrophic calamities.</h5><br>
<h6>At final, A GUI using Tkinter Module of python is made to interact the ML model with users. The UI takes input of cryospheric parameters and shows the prediction accordingly.</h6>
